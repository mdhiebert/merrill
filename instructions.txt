INSTRUCTIONS: EVERYTHING NEEDS TO FOLLOW THE SPECIFIC FORMAT OF:

<quantity>x <item description> (<serial numbers separated by a comma and space>)

Separate boxes with a new line and a #

e.g.

3x Really Awesome Item (1234, 5678, 1112)
1x Item I do have but have no serials but am still putting empty parentheses for ()
0x Item I don't have ()
100x Expendable item ()
#
4x Item in a new box (1, 2, 3, 4)
1x I am emphasizing the importance of a comma AND A SPACE (1, 2, 3, 4)
2x If the items were like this (1,2,3,4,5) <---- this would NOT WORK
